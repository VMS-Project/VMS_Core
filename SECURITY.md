# Security Policy

## REPORTING
So, you have found a security vulnerability. Please, be sure to responsibly disclose it to us by reporting a vulnerability under following Page:

](https://github.com/T1z3n/Visitor-Management-System/security/advisories/new)
## NON-QUALIFYING VULNERABILITIES
We will not accept reports of vulnerabilities of the following types:

> - Reports from automated tools or scanners.
> - Theoretical attacks without proof of exploitability.
> - Attacks that are the result of a third-party application or library (these should instead be reported to the library maintainers).
> - Social engineering.
> - Attacks involving physical access to a user’s device, or involving a device or network that’s already seriously compromised (like, man-in-the-middle).
> - Attacks that require the user to install a malicious other software, like a third-party integration, add-on, or plugin.
> - Attacks that the user can only perform against their own setup.
> - Privilege escalation attacks for logged in users

## SUPPORTED VERSIONS

## SEVERITY SCORING
If you are familiar with CVSS3.1, please provide the vulnerability score in your report in the shape of a vector string. There’s a calculator that can be helpful. If you are unsure how or unable to score a vulnerability, state that in your report, and we will look into it.

If you intend to provide a score, please familiarize yourself with CVSS first (we strongly recommend reading the Specification and Scoring Guide).
